((Yeah, A whole lotta bitching and moaning about my illegitimate ban from a regional  but sprinkled through this are some F'ing great ideas....))

I've mentioned to people at the Hive that I was apart of Burn2 in Second Life. I was banned from it for completely illegitimate reasons. And I remain banned due to pandaing to "a big name" despite their fall from competence to adhere to the 10 principles let alone the ranger handbook. 

Hell, my ban can easily be seen as our regional contact being complicit in or forced into conducting activities which break the contract they are under as a regional. 
I made a couple of formal complaints about the leads. With the exception of the acknowledgement of receipt. My next communication came in the form of a lifetime ban with no appeals. That was my first negative official communication from any part of the BM organization. Since 2008, where I was a core lead for the regional, the lead for DPW, a 007 Ranger.... 

Unfortunately for me, the people I complained about the conduct of either have the ear of or are minions of someone who is currently having petitions circulated over their missconduct. 
One now known as "Uncle Maga" who consistently posts things that are contrary to the 10p and then if called on it back-peddles calling it a joke or a form of creative expression...
Back in the Day I actually received a considerable amount of my Ranger training from that person. Back then he was known as Danger Ranger or M2. There is currently a policy seemingly to ignore core principles to what makes Burn what it was whilst people bit their tongues, look the other way and hope that he retires sooner rather than later. 

Prior to my ban... in fact the very project I had next up on my list to bring up and something I had done a fair amount of work on but had not put anything forwards publically was something that was actually very similar to Hive. 

I had been working on putting together a Github organization for use by the Regional.  Whilst initially it had been just to act as a store for code to be used by the regional. As I poked around within Github I turned it to be used for numerous other applications. 

* As mentioned it had intended to be a store for code for use by the regional.
[[https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Scripts]]

* I then looked into the possibilities of making use of the project management features to provide a centralised location for dealing with projects. E.g. The regionals Website
[[https://github.com/orgs/Burn2-0/projects/4]]

* There was also the possibility that it could be used for a method of communication with facilities for voting.... 
[[https://github.com/orgs/Burn2-0/discussions]]

* The closest I came to "Hive" was when I started to compile documentation... 
[[https://github.com/Burn2-0/sl-documentation]]

* Unfortunately, My ban came in the middle of my doing all the above... As such I refused to hand over all my hardwork for the betterment of the regional. I felt justified in that as of the 5-6 given reasons for my ban I could completely destroy they were I given an appeal chance. Basically leaving just the unspoken reason to ban me... That being to bury a complaint made against a fragile ego. My complaint was that the leads had not followed ranger guidelines in dealing with a contentious subject thereby causing a months long slugfest. The result of which had it been acknowledged would have required for their acknowledging it had not been handled the best and were they good leads they would have held their hands up admitted "mea culpa" and then looked at how to do better next time. Instead they tried bury it and ended up loosing 2 in 5 burners from the event from one year to the next, causing massive damage to the reputation of the regional and significant damage to the mental health of more than a few now former Burners.

(So named due to the banana republik bungling attempted authoritarian fictional place I invented to hold up a mirror to Burn2 to see what a shitshow things became... Something I had fully intended to be something that once they realised their idiocy and reversed my ban I would have removed it and handed over primary control to the regional.... The idiocracy remains...)

* There were a few other things I added that I figured where actually good ideas.
The Burn2 Accord Section. There were numerous occasions since my ban where my writing a whole lot of policy documents came up. Which was where I realised that "Legalese Code" could actually be dealt with via a Git Repo, That doing policy via a Git Repo encouraged participation, community effort and civic responsibility. As Git Repo Facilitates Bottom Up Management better than it does Top Down. 
(I also loved the idea of a burn of group of burners circling up some artcars, cobbling together toga from sheets and having some Roman Forum Style Political discussions deep playa.. concept image included in following link...)
[[https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Accord]]

  - One thing that they might still be working on (2 years aprx for the official version encounting) 
  was bylaws.  To prove a point about how much they were dawdling over something I was 
  told "Would be the only thing able to reverse my ban... *mic drop*" in a public meeting. I 
  decided to knock up a set of bylaws myself, something I'd done before, and I figured as I had 
  thought they project had died up to that point that maybe if someone presented a full set of 
  bylaws they might actually be at least able to use mine as a template to get the actual ones 
  done.  Mine took a few days to get to a state where I was ready for people to check them 
  out... And in the process of writing them I took myself from being "Pissed off, I'll show you 
  '*mic drop*'" to being re-inspired by the 10p and the meaning of the Burn.  
  [[https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Accord/blob/main/Draft/By-Laws-Talia/index.md]]

  - Another example came when I stumbled across a rather significant data breach. I had not 
  really been looking for it. But due to my RL work once I found it I could not ignore it. So I 
  reported it to the Burn2 Leads and the appropriate authorities. I explained to the lead in 
  charge of the website exactly what the problem was and what needed to be done to solve it.
  I also explained exactly what needed to be done to mitigate any legal issues that could 
  arise. It was just before a big event so everyone was pretty busy... with the exception of 
  myself as I was banned, and I figured as I'd found the breach, was being accused of sitting 
  on it until the worst possible moment (To reiterate in my RL career doing that even for Burn2 
  would have me blackballed) and I knew better than anyone what needed to be done. I ended 
  up compiling the Docu they had at the time. Managed to work out what was needed to 
  cover them for GDPR (both EU and UK), Copa (or whatever the californian one is) and 
  Canadian Privacy laws.  I created viable documents with Burner Flair to cover them for all 
  those that they were missing.
  To this day...As far as I am aware in response to the data-breach of personal data of 360 
  volunteers and performers all that was done was complete they "OMG DO THIS NOW!!!" first 
  step which was to make a text file in a particular directory and call the blank text file 
  "Index.html"..... 
  [[https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Accord/tree/main/Standards]]

  - It was also quite useful for keep 3rd party rules and regulations so people knew where they were... 
  E.g. [[https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Accord/blob/main/ThirdParty/BM/HarassmentDiscriminationRetaliastionPolicy.md]]
  Note the last half of the last paragraph.....
  > "Burning Man will not retaliate against any individual for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation, and will not tolerate or permitretaliation by management or any other staff member. If Burning Man determines that harassment or discrimination in violation of this Policy has occurred, appropriate remedial actions will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. Any staff member determined by Burning Man to be responsible for 
  unlawful harassment or discrimination will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination."

Okay so as an actual List.. 
 * Deep integration with GitHub...
 * Significant AI Support including Semantic Search Capabilities,  and possibly if there could be NotebookLM style functionalities that would be MARVELOUS!..
  (( Another thing that has come from my ban, as I was disallowed from doing anything 
     productive except for look for ways to try defend myself from injustice and slander. Ended 
     up compiling a NoteBookLM workbook with around 2.5 million words worth of info 
     surrounding Burn2. Burning Man and Second Life... SOOOOOO Useful... Like you wouldn't 
     believe ;) ))

My favourite youtube video of the moment... 
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTG2hg9j9I]]

If you wanted me to I could transfer significant parts of the Burn2 Github ORG over to Hive.
You know freedom of speech... extreme self expression etc..
