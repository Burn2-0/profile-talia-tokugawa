## About
I code therefore I am... 

## Stack
 * VCS - With these extensions secific to LSL

 * Firestorm - I use firestorm and usually make fairly heavy usage of the preprocessor.
   - I would like it if we could put together a unified code base using the prepro.
   - Until that is discussed I won't do anything that will make my code unusable without having a specific setup.
 * VPS - I have a VPS I can make use of where I primarily am a little old school prefering to stick with PHP/MySQL.
     
## Dialect
I do have some weirdnesses in my formating.
 * I have recently got into "Yoda Notation" i.e. rather than use ``` if (x==1) ``` you use ``` if (1==x) ``` The reason for this is good practise. If someone screws up doing Yoda notation the code won't compile.
 * Naming Schema:
   - Event Variables. My event variable will in theory always be a 3 letter code being abc a is the variable type and then bc is usually the acronym of the original.
   - PrePro Constants. Always ```ALL_CAPS```.
   - Local Variable. I try keep 1 or 2 characters long.
   - Global Varaible. 4 or more charaters long.
   - PrePro Variable. Prefixed with ```TT-```
   - PrePro Functions. Prefixed with ```TT-```
 * Code Density. I do like to try keep things very dense and have no problem in writing paragraphs of code, just as long as the context remains the same.
 * Comments. From Jupyter I do like to section of blocks with large comments. 







Thinking Profiles as repo might be quite good just as some where to note down any particular things you do... as well as giving a quick rundown as to what you run as your stack and skills etc.
